Datatypes in js :-
  -data types is an attributed with a pices of data that tells a computer system how to interpet its value.
  -in data types we used "typeof" operator to know that what type of data it is.
  -minly in javascript their are 2 types of data types.

  1.primitive:-
  -in javascript there are 7 types of premitive data types.
  1.number - number are the type of data types those it contain some numerical values.
  2.boolean - in boolean data types we get boolean value like true,false.
  3.undefined - in undefined data types the data is not define so that it will show undefined.
  4.null - in this data type we get null for the value means nothing.
  5.bigint - in bigint we will get big integer value
  6.symbol - in symbol we will get whole symbol as well as the value we get for the data type.
  7.string - string is a type of data type can hold some charecter like names...

  2.Reference or non-primitive :-
   - non primitive data type are the type of data type that can hold multiple items in a single time
   -non primitive data types are - object, array, function etc..
   -objects is a non primitive data types which can hold multiple of item in one single entity.
   -mainly objects are working on(key:value)pair.
   -the left side part is our keys of objects and right side are the objects of the project.
   ex.object -

   let student={
    name="puja rani",
    mob-no:8984584377,
    college="GIFT"
   }

   Operator in js:-
    -operator are the key features to do some task or operate some task.
    -ex. A+b
    -in this above example A,B are the operands and "+" is the operator.
    -there are 5 types of operator are their in javascript
    1.arithmetic operator
        (+,-,*,/,%,exponentiation->**)
    2.unary operator
        increment(++)
        decreament(--)
    3.assignment operator
        (assign some values to the variables)
        (=,+=,-=,*=,%=,**=)
    4.comparison operator
        (compair the values)
         it gives the result of true or false.
         equal to-> ==
         not equal to->!=
         equal to & type ->===
         not equal to & type->!==

    5.logical operator
        check the logic of the operator (true/false)
        logical AND (&&) -> tableof logical and operator is ->
        cond1   conf2  res(&&)
          T       T      T
          T       F      F
          F       T      F
          F       F      F

        logical OR(||) -> table of logical OR operator is ->
        cond1  cond2  res(&&)
        T       T       T
        T       F       T
        F       T       T
        F       F       F

        logical Not(!)
